      <!-- This is a placeholder since we moved the group_user_dropdown out
      of the left_panel and up into the template above.
      However, because 3rd-party apps have extended page templates E.g. webtagging_search
      and ode.seracher have extended search.html, which still include
      this group_user_dropdown.html.
      So, we've removed the menu from here, so search.html simply includes
      this blank placeholder and the real menu is now in
      group_user_dropdown2.html
      -->
