/** 
 * The Bhojpur ODE Build Tool.
 * 
 * This class is in charge of launching Apache Ant with a suitable environment.
 * 
 * <p>The workflow is (in principle) identical to the Ant Launcher class (see
 * <code>org.apache.tools.ant.launch.Launcher</code>): set up the required
 * system properties, locate all the required libraries (including the JDK
 * tools), and launch Ant with a suitable classpath and with whatever arguments
 * were supplied on the command line.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The implementation however is quite different. In fact, on one hand we
 * know exactly how the tool is deployed and run, so some aspects of the 
 * launch procedure can be simplified. On the other hand we tailor this
 * procedure to the needs of our build system.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The launch procedure assumes the following:</p>
 * <ul>
 *  <li>This class is compiled in the <i>build</i> directory under the
 *      Shoola CVS root. Its file name is <i>"ode.class"</i> and it 
 *      belongs to the default namespace (unnamed package).</li>
 *  <li>The <i>build</i> directory contains a sub-directory named <i>tools</i>.
 *      The latter contains the Ant core jars, the Ant jars for the optional 
 *      tasks that we use, and all the external libraries required for those
 *      optional tasks. Optionally, it may contain the Sun JDK tools jar.
 *      (Because of licensing issues, we can't add the <i>tools.jar</i> to CVS;
 *      however developers may want to drop that file into this directory after 
 *      downloading from CVS.)</li>
 *  <li>The Sun JDK tools can be accessed because the classes:
 *    <ul>
 *     <li>Are in the default classpath (boot, ext) of the JVM that is used to 
 *         invoke the Build Tool, or</li>
 *     <li>Are contained in a jar file named <i>"tools.jar"</i> under 
 *         <i>{java.home}/lib</i> (JDK installed; if {java.home} points to the
 *         <i>jre</i> directory within the JDK, then the jar is expected to be 
 *         in the <i>lib</i> sibling directory), or</li>
 *     <li>Are contained in a jar file under the <i>build/tools</i> directory.
 *         In this case, the version of the JDK tools is expected to be the
 *         same as the one of the JVM that is used to invoke the Build Tool.  
 *         (Failure to comply may result in compilation errors due to class 
 *         file version incompatibilities.)</li>
 *    </ul>
 *  </li>
 *  <li>The Build Tool is invoked with the following syntax: <code>java build 
 *      [options] [target1 [target2 [target3] ...]]</code>, where 
 *      <code>options</code> are any of the Ant options and <code>targetN</code>
 *      is any of the available targets. Note that we assume no classpath is
 *      ever specified to <code>java</code>.</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>A final important remark. Before dropping the JDK tools into
 * <i>build/tools</i>, you should make sure they're not available to the JVM
 * in use. (Just run the Build Tool to compile, if it fails the JDK tools are
 * not available.) This is important because if the JDK tools are already
 * available, adding a copy under <i>build/tools</i> would result in having
 * two sets of JDK tools classes on the classpath. As you can imagine, some
 * nasty runtime behavior could originate from that if the JDK tools have
 * different versions.</p>
