</head>
<body bgcolor="white">

Contains the central verbs of the Bhojpur ODE System.
    
<p>
  The Bhojpur ODE API as outlined by this package will be made available to all 
  programming languages supported by Bhojpur ODE. Other "local" APIs are available
  for server only programming.
</p>
  
<p>
  The interfaces contained here are also specially marked in order to allow
  special processing by the container. StatefulServiceInterface, for example,
  allows for the triggering of container events on creation and destruction
  of a non-singleton service.
