## DO NOT EDIT!
##
## This properties file is compiled into ode-server.jar and serves as a default
## for all server-side values (client configuration happens differently).
##
## Any of these properties can be altered by using :program:`ode config`. MODIFYING
## THIS FILE DOES NOT ALTER SERVER BEHAVIOR. It solely defines the defaults
## at compile time!

## Properties marked with "DEVELOPMENT" should not be used in production.

# A // may be used as a path separator: the directories preceding
# it are created with root ownership, the remainder are the user's.
# At least one user-owned directory must be included in the path.

# Rules to apply to judge the acceptability of FS paths for writing into
# :property:`ode.managed.dir`, being any comma-separated non-empty subset of:
#
# - Windows required
# - Windows optional
# - UNIX required
# - UNIX optional
# - local required
# - local optional
#
# Minimally, the "required" appropriate for the server is recommended.
# Also applying "optional" rules may make sysadmin tasks easier,
# but may be more burdensome for users who name their files oddly.
# "local" means "Windows" or "UNIX" depending on the local platform,
# the latter being applied for Linux and Mac OS X.

# - Murmur3-32
# - Murmur3-128
# - SHA1-160
# - File-Size-64

# In negotiation with clients, this list is interpreted as being in
# descending order of preference.
