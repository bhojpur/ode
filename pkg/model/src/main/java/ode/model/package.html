Central interfaces in the Bhojpur ODE object model.
  
<p>
  These interfaces provide as much common functionality as possible so that
  working with object graphs does not always require casting.
</p>
  
<p>
  The subpackages of ode.model are less documented because they are code 
  generated. Please see the specification or the individual package 
  descriptions for more information.
