Additional settings can be configured by changing the properties below. Before changing the properties, run ``export PATH=/opt/ode/web/venv3/bin:$PATH``:

- :property:`ode.web.wsgi_workers` to (2 x NUM_CORES) + 1

  .. note::
      **Do not** scale the number of workers to the number of clients
      you expect to have. ODE.web should only need 4-12 worker
      processes to handle many requests per second.

- :property:`ode.web.wsgi_args` Additional arguments. For more details
  check `Gunicorn Documentation <https://docs.gunicorn.org/en/stable/settings.html>`_. For example to enable **debugging**, run the following command::

      ode config set ode.web.wsgi_args -- "--log-level=DEBUG --error-logfile={{ ode_user_web_dir }}/var/log/error.log"
