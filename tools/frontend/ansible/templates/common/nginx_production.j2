For production servers you may need to add additional directives to the configuration file, for example to enable `HTTPS <https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/configuring_https_servers.html>`_. As an alternative to manually modifying the generated file you can generate a minimal configuration and include this in your own manually created NGINX file, such as :file:`/etc/nginx/conf.d/ode-web.conf`:

::

    ode web config nginx-location > {{ ode_user_web_dir }}/ode-web-location.include
